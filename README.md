## Behind the project

One tough milestone in life is to witness people around us grow old, be it our grandparents, parents, family, or ourselves. Alzheimer's Disease is the most common type of dementia, which is a brain degenerative disease that gradually cause impairment in memory, thinking and behaviour. Both of us have experienced this happening to our dear ones, motivating us to build a product with a virtual caregiver in mind.

We hope the product would help people experiencing Alzheimer's to carry out daily tasks and hold onto what they find precious, while alleviating the mental burden of caregivers.

## About the project
Current features include:
- Daily task reminders (with detailed steps, including both physical and mental care)
- Daily memory reminders (reminds them of people and moments they found precious)
